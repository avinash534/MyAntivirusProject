Thank you for your interest in contributing to MyAntivirusProject! This project is a demo antivirus program, and I welcome contributions to improve its functionality, fix bugs, or enhance documentation.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

- Include details like steps to reproduce, your operating system (e.g., Windows 11), and any error messages.

### Suggesting Features
- Open a GitHub issue with the label "enhancement".
- Describe the feature, why it’s useful, and any implementation ideas.

### Submitting Code
1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`.
3. Make your changes and test them thoroughly.
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add your feature description"`.

- Use meaningful variable names (e.g., `file_hash` instead of `fh`).
- Add comments for complex logic.
